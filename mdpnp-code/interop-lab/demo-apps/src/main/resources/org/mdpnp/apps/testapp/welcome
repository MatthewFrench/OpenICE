Welcome to the MD PnP Demonstration Applications!

Please select the component you would like to launch:

ICE_Supervisor
The Supervisor is the host for clinical apps.  Launching this component will also create an ICE Network Controller.

ICE_Device_Interface
The Device Interface allows you to connect devices to the ICE Supervisor.  Don't worry if you have no devices as several simulated devices are available.

If you selected ICE_Device_Interface you will further be asked which device you would like to connect.  If the device is connected via a serial port please select that port under "Address".  If the device is connected on the network type it's address in the provided text field.
